* List comprehensions are often much easier to read than the associated `map` and `filter` code, when running basic computations.
* `map` requires `lambda` functions, or a whole function definition, which is verbose.
* You can apply basic filters with list comprehensions using conditional statements, where with `map` you'd have to combine with `filter`, or again, write a bigger standalone function.
